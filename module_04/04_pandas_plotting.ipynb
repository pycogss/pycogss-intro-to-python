Pandas has many [built-in functions](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html) to make plotting your DataFrames easy. In particular, an advantage `pandas` has over Excel is that it is <i>exceptionally</i> easy to add colors to your points based on values from a third column, resulting in compact, data-rich visualizations. There is another package, [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), which we will encounter later that adds additional functionality and visualization methods to your DataFrames.
