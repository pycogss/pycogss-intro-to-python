    "## What is Python?\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html) is a programming language, which helps you deliver commands to a computer (and Ptyhon is a \"high-level\" language, which means that it looks more like human language instead of computer `beeps` and `boops`, which is good for us scientists). Python is a very popular language for many use cases and fields, and over the past decade it has been increasingly adopted by research scientists who write packages (more on that soon) to do their work (R is another language that scientists also like to use, but its packages have historically focused on statistics). It is also free to download and use, which is great and in contrast to Matlab, which is perhaps the other language that geoscientists may have encountered. It is indeed named after Monty Python's Flying Circus. "

Variables and their values are stored in memory and can be accessed and modified across different cells. If cells are not executed in order, the variable state might be different from what you expect, leading to errors or unexpected behavior. Code cells may depend on variables or functions defined in previous cells. If you skip executing certain cells or execute them out of order, you may encounter errors due to missing dependencies. \n",
