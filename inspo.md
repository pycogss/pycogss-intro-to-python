# Basics of Python
Software Carpentry has a few courses for beginners. The [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) course will get you started with a slightly broader skillset compared to the [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) lesson, which confusingly focuses more on "data science" skills (including visualizing data) than the "Plotting and Programming" lesson. Although they are not the focus of this course, if you continue as a scientific programmer I also recommend their [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) course to teach the basics of managing files and versions of those files in local or remote repositories (like GitHub), as well as [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) course, which will help you navigate any cluster computer environment that one might have at a research institute. 

# Basics for Earth observation
CU Boulder's Earth Lab has various [courses](https://earthdatascience.org/courses/), including an [Earth Analytics Bootcamp Course](https://earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-bootcamp/). The bootcamp course looks a lot like the first six modules of my course. A course focused on geospatial data is the [Use Data for Earth and Environmental Science in Open Source Python](https://earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/) course (also called the "Intermediate earth data science textbook"). 

# Advanced topics 
Performing "scalable and reproducible" science requires advanced command of scientific packages as well as efficient file navigation and creation, efficient parsing of tabular or web databases, paralellization, and much more. I learned so much from the Arctic Data Center's [Scalable and Computationally Reproducible Approaches to Arctic Research](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2025-04-arctic/) series of workshops. Another textbook that taught me a lot was Ryan Abernathy's [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html). 

And I would be remiss to point out that I initially learned Python to play with [Landlab](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html) at a CSDMS coding bootcamp (which I attended two years in a row because it didn't quite stick the first time! So practice makes perfect.)
